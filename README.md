# WidgetBuildingBricks
Repository containing, for each atomic widget, its FSA and the relative SCXML implementation.

# ToDo

Modify the statecharts' PNG to match with the current scxml implementation.

# Useful Information

In each scxml implementation, the states "pre" and "post" are just dummies. When actually implementing a complex widget, the user should replace those entries with real states/transitions.
